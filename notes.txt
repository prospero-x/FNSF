debye Lengths: 906
1 grid point per debye length
20 time steps per gyroperiod
1 ion acoustic transit time
500 particles per cell

Deuterium real density: 5.62227e20
Deuterium particles in simulation: 234367

debye length for this simulation: 5e-7m

therefore: domain is 906 * 5e-7 = 4.53e-4m
In a region this big, there should be:
